The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 09, 2020].

I will dedicate 3 hours everyday to this challenge which involves 40 mins of learning a new language/framework/skill, 40 mins of Software Engineering (Algorithms to Architecture), 30 mins on self-help, and 70 mins of working on a side-project or contributing to the open-source project [this is the actual part of the challenge since courses/tutorials/reading won't count for the challenge.]

- Langauge/Framework/Skill: Master JavaScript, GraphQL, and Gatsby Framework
- Software Engineering: Data Structures, Algorithms and Object-Oriented Software Engineering
- Self-Help: Read Soft-Skills, The Sprint, The 4-Hour Work Week.
- Project [Actual Challenge]: Build all the mock-ups from frontendmentor.io using Gatsby + Side Project + Blog!
